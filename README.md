This project uses a novel interpolation-based method to solve a set of DAEs alongside the difference equations of the digital controller.

## How to use
There are 2 case studies named __*Integral Controller*__, and __*SMIB*__ for simulation of the classical integral controller, and the SMIB system, respectively, used in the paper.


### Simulation settings

We have assumed a fixed time step size containing five intermediate points.
